### Movie-Recommendation-System
##### Collaborative filtering based project:
- Created a movie recommendation system using user-based collaborative filtering method following a memory-based approach.
- Mined dataset from Grouplens website having 20 million movie ratings since 1995 with attributes governed by users and implemented in Apache GraphX.

- A movie recommendation system is a computer-based system that uses data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. 
- These systems analyze user preferences, such as ratings of movies they have seen, to generate a list of recommended movies. 
- The system also looks at factors such as actor/actress, plot, genre, and user's past viewing habits to generate the list. 
- The output of the recommendation system can be tailored to a specific user's taste, making it more likely they will find a movie they will enjoy watching.
