### Movie-Recommendation-System
##### Collaborative filtering based project:
- Created a movie recommendation system using user-based collaborative filtering method following a memory-based approach.
- Mined dataset from Grouplens website having 20 million movie ratings since 1995 with attributes governed by users and implemented in Apache GraphX.

- A movie recommendation system is a computer-based system that uses data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. 
- These systems analyze user preferences, such as ratings of movies they have seen, to generate a list of recommended movies. 
- The system also looks at factors such as actor/actress, plot, genre, and user's past viewing habits to generate the list. 
- The output of the recommendation system can be tailored to a specific user's taste, making it more likely they will find a movie they will enjoy watching.

- User based collaborative filtering uses the ratings of other users to create recommendations for a given user. 
- This approach is based on the assumption that users with similar tastes tend to rate items similarly. 
- To create a recommendation, the algorithm looks at a user's past ratings and finds other users with similar ratings, then calculates a recommendation based on their ratings. 
- This type of filtering can be used to find items that a user may be interested in, such as movies, books, or music.
- It uses the past behavior of users to generate recommendations. It relies on the idea that users with similar tastes and preferences in the past will also have similar tastes and preferences in the future.
- This approach works by first finding the most similar users to the active user. 
- It then uses the ratings of the most similar users to make predictions about what the active user might like. 
- The predictions are based on the ratings of the similar users. 
- The more similar the users are, the more accurate the predictions will be.
- For example, let’s say Bob is an active user and he has rated several movies. We can find the most similar users to Bob and use their ratings to make recommendations for Bob. We can compare Bob’s ratings to the ratings of the most similar users and recommend movies that they have rated highly, but that Bob has not seen yet. This is a simple example of user-based collaborative filtering.
